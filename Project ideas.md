Idea 1) a remote control bot, if possible a mini R2D2.

I choose an Rc bot because I think it would be really cool to make something move.

Idea 2) a device to restrict feeding to specific times in food restrictive experiments.

I choose this because. While working in the lab taking food off and putting it back on for mice is time consuming. It would be really cool to try and make something that will do it for me.
